    Welcome to the qb-tradingcard configuration!

    This script is designed to offer an interactive and customizable trading card system for your server.
    Before diving into configuration, please carefully read the instructions and documentation provided below.

    ### Key Points to Understand:
    1. **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Each crucial configuration will be highlighted and explained in detail within this file.
    2. **Customization Freedom**: Most settings are fully customizable to fit the unique needs of your framework (ESX, QBCore, etc.).
    3. **Custom Files**: The primary configuration files are organized under the `client/custom/*` and `server/custom/*` directories.
       Feel free to modify these files to adapt the system to your server's environment.

    ### Configuration Tips:
    - Look for configuration boxes (like this one) for detailed explanations of each setting.
    - Pay attention to comments for recommendations, common issues, and potential impacts of changes.
    - Always back up your changes before modifying core files to ensure no data is lost.

    ### Documentation:
    For full installation instructions, setup guides, and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation here:
    üîó **https://docs.quasar-store.com/**

    üí° **Pro Tip**: If you're new to configuring assets, consult a developer or a community support group to ensure optimal setup.

    Language Selection Configuration

    The first step in customizing this asset is selecting your preferred language.
    Below, you‚Äôll find a list of all the default language options available in the `locales/*` directory.
    If your desired language is not included, you can create a custom locale file and add it yourself.

    ### How to Add a New Language:
    1. Navigate to the `locales/` folder.
    2. Duplicate any existing locale file as a template (e.g., `en.lua`).
    3. Rename the file to your desired language code (e.g., `my.lua` for a custom language).
    4. Translate the contents of the file to your language.
    5. Update the `Config.Language` setting to match your new language.

    ### Default Languages Available:
        'ar'     -- Arabic
        'bg'     -- Bulgarian
        'ca'     -- Catalan
        'cs'     -- Czech
        'da'     -- Danish
        'de'     -- German
        'el'     -- Greek
        'en'     -- English
        'es'     -- Spanish
        'fa'     -- Persian
        'fr'     -- French
        'hi'     -- Hindi
        'hu'     -- Hungarian
        'it'     -- Italian
        'ja'     -- Japanese
        'ko'     -- Korean
        'nl'     -- Dutch
        'no'     -- Norwegian
        'pl'     -- Polish
        'pt'     -- Portuguese
        'ro'     -- Romanian
        'ru'     -- Russian
        'sl'     -- Slovenian
        'sv'     -- Swedish
        'th'     -- Thai
        'tr'     -- Turkish
        'zh-CN'  -- Chinese (Simplified)
        'zh-TW'  -- Chinese (Traditional)

    üîó **Pro Tip**: When creating a new locale, ensure that your translations are accurate and formatted correctly to avoid issues in the system.

    Framework Detection System

    This script automatically detects which framework your server is using (qb-core, es_extended, or qbx_core).
    If you have renamed any of these frameworks, you can remove the value from `Config.Framework` and manually
    assign it after making the necessary modifications in the framework files inside this script.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
    - This system is designed to work automatically.
    - Do not edit or modify this section unless you fully understand its functionality.
    - Incorrect changes may result in the script not functioning properly.

    Framework Compatibility:
    - qb-core
    - es_extended (1.2 or legacy)
    - qbx_core (derived from qb-core)

    This script will throw an error if no compatible framework is detected, ensuring you are notified early.
]]

    Inventory System Configuration for PSA Stash

    This section is designed to configure the PSA stash system. It works by integrating with
    your existing inventory system, requiring specific events from the inventory to function correctly.

    To add support for a different inventory system:
    1. Copy and replicate the steps in `server/custom/inventory/*` to include your inventory's events.
    2. Add your inventory to the `inventories` table below following the given format.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
    - Make sure the correct inventory is detected by the script.
    - If your inventory is not listed, you need to manually add its events and integrate it properly.

    Supported Inventories:
    - `ox_inventory`
    - `qs-inventory`
    - `qb-inventory`
    - `core_inventory`
    - `origen_inventory`
    - `codem-inventory`

    General Configuration for Trading Card System

    This section includes all the general settings for the trading card system.
    You can customize both the client and server behavior in the "custom" folder
    provided with this asset. Below, you'll also find a list of predefined objects
    and configuration settings. Please refer to the documentation for further details.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

    Debug Mode Configuration
    This section is designed to provide advanced debugging and visual testing options.
    - **Debug Mode**: Enables constant system logs and prints for tracking processes and identifying potential issues.
    - **Visual Mode**: Useful for testing the visual aspects of the system, such as animations or UI.
      Note: Visual mode is non-functional; it does not distribute actual cards from packs.
    These features are intended for developers or advanced users. Avoid enabling them on production servers.
