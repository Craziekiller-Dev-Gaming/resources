# 919 ADMIN

Thank you for purchasing my resource 919 ADMIN CLASSIC. 

# Installation
Installation of 919ADMIN CLASSIC is simple, and involves drag-and-dropping the resource as well as some basic configuration.

- Extract the resource to the server files directory.
- Install the following resource to make the screenshots work https://github.com/jaimeadf/discord-screenshot (**THIS RUNS ALONGSIDE SCREENSHOT-BASIC**)
- Edit the file config.lua, config_server.lua, config_permissions.lua (and optionally config_integrations.lua) to your liking.
- Ensure the resource in server.cfg: add `ensure amzn_admin_classic` at the END of your load order.
